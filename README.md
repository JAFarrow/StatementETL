# StatementETL

StatementETL stems from a desire to extract my transactions from personal bank statements and store them locally.

Using docling and pandas, I intend to extract the tables from statements into a dataframe.

After ensuring correct extraction and cleaning / formatting where needed, I will load it into a local database for storage.

This project may evolve into some element of data visualization as well.
